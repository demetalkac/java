              || means "or": If you use "||" between 2 things it means at least 1 of them is enough for you
                     For example; "tea || coffee" means just tea, or just coffee, or both
                     To get false from || operation all must be false
                     true || true ==> true
                     true || false ==> true
                     false || true ==> true
                     false || false ==> false
                  Note: "|" checks both conditions.
                          "||" does not check the second condition, if first one is true
                          "||" is faster than "|"

               && means "and":  If you use "&&" between 2 things it means you want both.
                      For example; "tea && coffee" means I want both, just one of them will not be enough
                      To get true from && operation all must be true.
                      true && true ==> true
                      true && false ==> false
                      false && true ==> false
                      false && false ==> false
            & means "and":  If you use "&" between 2 things it means you want both.
                      For example; "tea & coffee" means I want both, just one of them will not be enough
                      To get true from && operation all must be true.
                      true & true ==> true
                      true & false ==> false
                      false & true ==> false
                      false & false ==> false
            Note: "&" and "&&" do the same but
           "&&" does not check the second condition if the first condition is false.
           "&" checks both conditions every time.
