         /*  Requirements:
      ***. Arrays are created to put more values in a single data type.

        1. How to create an Array?
                String names[]= new String[2];
        names[0]= "Mac";
        names[1]= "HP";

        int ages[]= new int[3];
        ages[0]= 18;
        ages[1]= 25;
        ages[2]= 33;

        short and efficient way:

        String names[]= {Mac, Windows, HP, Acer, Sony};
        int ages[]= {18, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 190};

        2.How to print an Array?
                System.out.println(Arrays.toString(names));

        3. How to print a specific element in an Array?
                System.out.println(names[3]);

        4. How to find the first element in an Array?
                Arrays are created as indexes. So zero  [0] always gives us the first element of an Array.

        5. How to find the last element in an Array?
                length-1 method always gives us the last element of an Array.
        ages[ages.length-1]

        6. How to do alphabetical or ascending order in an Array?
                Arrays.sort(array name);
        always gives us alphabetical or ascending order in an Array

        7. When we want to get the sum of the certain elements in Array for example first and last, we will do regular concatenation on printing.
        for example: system.out.println(ages[0] + ages[ages.length-1]);

        But when we want to get the sum of the all elements in Array, we need to create a container and use the below formula with for each loops as dynamic.
        int  sum= 0;
        for (int w: prices){
            sum= sum + w;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);


        8. When we want to get the elements before an element in Array we need to use "for each loop" and "if" with "break", for example:

        for(string w: names)
            if if (w.equals("Tom")){

            break;
        }
        9. When we want to get the elements different from an element in Array, we need to use "for each loop" and "if" with "continue", for example:

        for(string w: names)
            if if (w.equals("Tom")){

            continue;
        }

    }
}
